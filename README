Ustad Mobile HTML5 Cross Platform App

Copyright UstadMobile Inc 2013-2014.

UstadMobile can download content created using eXe ( an eLearning authoring
tool ) to a device and use that content even when offline.

Content is downloaded according to an XML manifest; the app runs an internal
HTTP server to ensure that content is sandboxed in a different javascript context
and cannot be used for malicious purposes against the host device.

Supported Platforms:

* Android (Built using Apache Cordova)
* Windows 7/8 (Built using NodeWebKit)

Work In Progress:

* iOS (Cordova)
* Blackberry 10 (Cordova)
* Windows Phone 8
