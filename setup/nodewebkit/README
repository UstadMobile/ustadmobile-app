# 
# UstadMobile NodeWebKit Version
#

NodeWebKit is the Chromium browser running with Node; NodeWebKit packages are 
zip files with the extension .nw  .  This version uses NodeJS methods and not
the Corova methods

To Run Tests:

1. Make sure nw executable from NodeWebKit is in path
2. If running Windows: make sure 7zip 7z is in the path
3. Make sure that the package ttf-mscorefonts-installer (requires cabextract)
   is installed ... otherwise NodeWebKit will crash
4. Copy js/ustad-test-credentials.sample.js to ustad-test-credentials.js
   and enter a username/password from the UMCloud server for the login 
   test

./unit-test-setup-nodewebkit.sh

To Build:

./setup-nodewebkit.sh run 

If you have already installed node modules and want to buidl offline:
export BUILDOFFLINE=1

To run without coverage (e.g. debugging):
export COVERAGE=0

Will make the .nw file

To make distributable packages:

./nw2packages.sh ./build/UstadMobile.nw

Will make a Zip containing everything needed on Windows
