# nativeDroid

A clean jQuery Mobile Theme inspired by the native GUI of Android 4.x

Demo-Link: **<http://nativedroid.godesign.ch/>**

## how to implement nativeDroid?

nativeDroid is basically a theme for jQuery Mobile so you can use any functionality provided by jQM but for a better looking design there are a few tweaks to respect:

* **nice to know**
 - all styles are applied to `data-theme='b'`
 - the `data-inset='true|false'` parameter is not working in nativeDroid
 - Use the wrapping &lt;div class='inset'&gt;-Tag instead
 - use the `data-role='header'` only in combination with `data-position='fixed'` and `data-tap-toggle='false'` and specificly apply the `data-theme='b'` to link elements inside the header

**As a best practice we recommend you to start by copying one of the HTML-Documents from the demonstration**

## colors & styles

* **Basic CSS**
 - `css/font-awesome.min.css` contains the fonts and icons used in nativeDroid.
 - `http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.4.2/jquery.mobile-1.4.2.min.css` original structure for jQuery Mobile without any theme (minified).
 - `css/jquerymobile.nativedroid.css` contains the structure adjustments needed for nativeDroid.
* **Theme**
 - `css/jquerymobile.nativedroid.light.css` contains the light-theme.
 - `css/jquerymobile.nativedroid.dark.css` contains the dark-theme.
* **Colors**
 - `css/jquerymobile.nativedroid.color.blue.css` blue-color style.
 - `css/jquerymobile.nativedroid.color.green.css` green-color style.
 - `css/jquerymobile.nativedroid.color.purple.css` purple-color style.
 - `css/jquerymobile.nativedroid.color.red.css` purple-color style.
 - `css/jquerymobile.nativedroid.color.yellow.css` yellow-color style.

**To create your own color-style simply copy one of the basic color.css-files and adjust the few color codes as you like.**
