2/May/2014 - Last updated by Mike Dawson

To build:

./setup-android.sh 

To run on connected device (must have USB debugging enabled):

./setup-android.sh run

NOTE: If the app is installed from the app store you MUST remove it;
otherwise you will receive an error re. inconsistent certificates

To run emulator:

./setup-android.sh emulate

To release (sign and zipalign):

Copy release-settings-android.sh.example to release-settings-android.sh
Add your keystore path and alias
Then run ./release-android.sh

Notes:

Icons come from res/icons/android

To test app (unit tests automatically in emulator)

Then run: ./unit-test-setup-android.sh emulate
You could run the tests on device directly: ./unit-test-setup-android.sh run

The test results will be sent to UstadMobile Cloud (umclouddj)
