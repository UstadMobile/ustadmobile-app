To build:

./setup-android.sh 

To run on connected device (must have USB debugging enabled):

./setup-android.sh run

NOTE: If the app is installed from the app store you MUST remove it;
otherwise you will receive an error re. inconsistent certificates

To run emulator:

./setup-android.sh emulate


To run unit tests:

1. For fully automated testing an emulator must be installed.  For performance
 it is recommended to follow steps below:

2. Set the AVDNAME variable in unit-test-setup-android.sh

3. run ./unit-test-setup-android.sh emulate to run in emulator or 
 ./unit-test-setup-android.sh run to run on device connected in debug mode




To release (sign and zipalign):

Copy release-settings-android.sh.example to release-settings-android.sh
Add your keystore path and alias
Then run ./release-android.sh

Notes:

Icons come from res/icons/android
