UstadMobile Android Hybrid App Building + Testing
=================================================

The environment consists of three projects:

1. The main UstadMobile android project that is to use a CordovaWebView
 to run most of the action
2. A blank cordova project that contains the CordovaLib project, used as
 a library project by the main UstadMobile android project
3. An Android test project for unit testing purposes

GETTING STARTED:
================

1. Create the Cordova Project
$ ./make-cordovalib-project.sh

2. Compile the debug application
$ cd ustadmobileandroid && ant debug

3. Run tests
$ cd ustadmobileandroid_tests
$ ant [emma] debug install test

emma is optional for coverage: It may or may not function depending on
permissions copying from device to system using adb

Projects can be imported into eclipse using file - import - existing 
android code into workspace.  You must import all three projects.

SETUP PROJECTS FROM SCRATCH
===========================

./make-env.sh is used to create blank Android projects
